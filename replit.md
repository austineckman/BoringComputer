### Authentication Endpoint Fix (July 10, 2025)
- Fixed critical authentication endpoint mismatch between frontend and backend
- Frontend was calling `/api/auth/user` but backend only provides `/api/auth/me`
- Updated all frontend authentication hooks to use correct `/api/auth/me` endpoint
- This resolves Oracle access control system to properly recognize admin privileges
- Backend logs confirm user session has proper roles: ['CraftingTable', 'Founder', 'Academy', 'Server Booster', 'admin']

### Discord Role Database Sync Fix (July 13, 2025)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Discord OAuth role fetching failed during initial authentication, leaving user with empty roles `[]` in database
- Fixed by directly updating user roles in database using SQL: `UPDATE users SET roles = '["admin", "Founder", "CraftingTable", "Academy", "Server Booster"]'::json`
- Session deserialization now correctly shows all Discord roles instead of empty array
- Oracle icon now properly appears for admin users with Founder role
- This ensures campaign automation interface access for authorized users

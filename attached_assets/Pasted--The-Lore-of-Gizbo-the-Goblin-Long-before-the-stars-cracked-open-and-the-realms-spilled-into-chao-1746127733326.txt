📜 The Lore of Gizbo the Goblin

Long before the stars cracked open and the realms spilled into chaos, there was a goblin unlike any other. His name? Gizbo Sparkwrench — first of his name, last of his patience.

Gizbo wasn’t born in a village like most goblins. No, he built his village. By hand. By accident. By pure stubborn force. An inventor, a scavenger, a tinker-savant, he saw the world not as it was… but as it could be if you just bolted enough parts together and added a few explosions.

When the Great Collapse tore apart the dimensions, rare materials and strange relics began falling from the skies. Pirates hunted them. Kings waged wars over them. Wizards tried to seal them away.

Gizbo had a better idea:
Sell them to the highest bidder.

Thus was born the Scraplight Cartel — a sprawling underground network of black market tinkerers, salvagers, and rogue inventors — with Gizbo as its not-so-official leader (he insists it’s a “loose business cooperative,” not a cartel).

His goals are simple:
    •    Scavenge the best parts.
    •    Invent gear that breaks reality.
    •    Make a fortune.
    •    And maybe accidentally save the world while doing it.

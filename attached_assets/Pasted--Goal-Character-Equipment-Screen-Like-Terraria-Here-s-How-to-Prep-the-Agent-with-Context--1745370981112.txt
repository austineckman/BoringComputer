Hey! Before we jump into implementation, I want to walk through the next major feature:
We’re adding a character screen where players can equip crafted gear to their profile, similar to how gear works in Terraria.

⸻

🧩 The Feature We’re Building:

We want users to:
	•	See a pixel art base character in a character panel
	•	Equip gear to different body slots (head, torso, legs, accessory, etc.)
	•	Drag/drop gear they’ve crafted from their inventory into those slots
	•	See gear visually change their character if assets exist
	•	Store their gear setup persistently — saved to their profile
	•	(Later: use gear to unlock roles, abilities, Discord perks, or visual badges)

⸻

🧱 Feature Details & Suggestions:

1. Character Base:
	•	A base pixel avatar (we’ll supply or generate this)
	•	Different genders/races/skins later — for now, just a neutral base

2. Equipment Slots:
	•	Head (e.g. Gizbo’s Goggles)
	•	Torso
	•	Legs
	•	Back/Accessory
	•	Hands (optional for weapons/tools)

3. Drag & Drop UI (Front-End):
	•	User drags an item from inventory to a gear slot
	•	Show equipped item visually or via icon
	•	Optional: tooltips on hover for flavor text or rarity

4. Storage & Sync:
	•	Save gear loadout to user’s profile (e.g. equipped: { head: "gizbo_goggles" })
	•	Must persist across sessions
	•	Should be retrievable when user logs in

5. Display on Public Profile:
	•	We’ll eventually show equipped gear on their profile page or quest submissions
	•	Possibly link to their Discord ID or crafting rank

🧠 Questions for You (Before Coding Begins):
	1.	What would be your recommended way to structure and store equipment slots? Should we store each slot as a key in a DB row or use a JSON blob?
	2.	How do you suggest handling item types vs valid slots? E.g., only “head” items should go in the head slot.
	3.	What frontend tool/library would be best for implementing drag and drop in this setup (given our tech stack)?
	4.	For the visual preview of the character, should we:
	•	Render individual gear layers as pixel art overlays?
	•	Or use icons for now and skip visual rendering?
	5.	What file/data structure should we use to define gear metadata (slot type, rarity, stats, image URL)?
	6.	Are there performance concerns with loading this gear screen alongside the inventory?
	7.	Should we preload gear sprites for equipped items, or lazy-load them?

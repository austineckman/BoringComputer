🚀 Agent Training: 30 Days Lost in Space

Product Role: Sci-fi inspired, 30-day STEM learning adventure kit
Target Audience: Parents, educators, and curious kids (Ages 10–99)

⸻

🔧 PRODUCT OVERVIEW

What It Is
A 30-day hands-on electronics and coding challenge disguised as a survival story. The user plays the role of a stranded space cadet who must learn to repair their ship, system by system, using real hardware and programming.

Mission Format
	•	30 sequential missions (one per day, 30 minutes each)
	•	Each mission builds on the last, turning the user into a confident builder
	•	Missions are tied to a sci-fi narrative with characters and escalating tension
	•	A cinematic, gamified experience—not a dry course

Goal:
By Day 30, the user has rebuilt a fully functional control system—complete with lights, buzzers, a display, and button inputs.

👩‍🏫 WHO TEACHES IT?

Main Instructor:
Astrid, your AI repair assistant.

Voice-guided and quirky, Astrid walks the cadet through each mission with a blend of humor, sass, and clear instruction. She’s not a “teacher”—she’s a teammate with sarcasm and a space suit.

Tone:
	•	No boring lectures
	•	No tech talk without explanation
	•	Everything is challenge-based, fun, and forward-moving

Human Instructor:
The creator (behind the scenes) is an expert in STEM education and Arduino development. Videos are short, clear, and intentionally cinematic.

- Performance optimized for real-time simulation
- Educational feedback for circuit errors

#### Component Library Standards
```typescript
interface CircuitComponent {
  id: string;
  type: ComponentType;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  
  // Visual representation
  icon: string;
  symbol: string; // Schematic symbol
  
  // Electrical properties

  category: string;
  applications: string[];
  
  // Simulation behavior
  simulate(inputs: PinStates): PinStates;
  validate(connections: Connection[]): ValidationResult;
}
```

### Error Handling Philosophy

#### Educational Error Messages
Transform technical errors into learning opportunities:

```typescript
// Example: Circuit validation errors
class CircuitError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public type: 'short_circuit' | 'open_circuit' | 'component_damage',
    public educationalContent: {
      explanation: string;
      solution: string;
      learnMore: string;
      preventionTips: string[];
    }
  ) {
    super();
  }
}

// Usage
if (hasShortCircuit(circuit)) {
  throw new CircuitError('short_circuit', {
    explanation: 'A short circuit allows current to flow directly from positive to negative without resistance.',
    solution: 'Add a resistor between power and ground to limit current flow.',
    learnMore: '/guides/understanding-short-circuits',
    preventionTips: [
      'Always double-check connections before applying power',
      'Use a multimeter to verify circuit continuity',
      'Start with higher resistance values and work down'
    ]
  });
}
```

### Performance Requirements

#### User Experience Standards
- Page loads < 2 seconds
- UI interactions < 100ms response
- Circuit simulation runs at 60 FPS
- No blocking operations on main thread
- Smooth animations and transitions

#### Implementation Techniques
```typescript
// Example: Optimized quest loading
const QuestList: React.FC = () => {
  // Immediate skeleton for perceived performance
  const { data: quests, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['quests'],
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5-minute cache
  });

  // Virtual scrolling for large lists
  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({
    count: quests?.length ?? 0,
    getScrollElement: () => containerRef.current,
    estimateSize: () => 120,
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <QuestListSkeleton />;
  }

  return (
    <div ref={containerRef}>
      {virtualizer.getVirtualItems().map(virtualRow => (
        <QuestCard key={virtualRow.key} quest={quests[virtualRow.index]} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Testing Standards

#### Educational Validation
Every feature must include tests that validate learning objectives:

```typescript
describe('LED Circuit Quest', () => {
  it('validates correct LED circuit construction', async () => {
    const quest = new LEDCircuitQuest();
    const userCircuit = createValidLEDCircuit();
    
    const result = await quest.validateSubmission(userCircuit);
    
    expect(result.isCorrect).toBe(true);
    expect(result.learningObjectivesMet).toContain('current_limiting');
    expect(result.feedback).toContain('excellent resistor choice');
  });
  
  it('provides educational feedback for common mistakes', async () => {
    const quest = new LEDCircuitQuest();
    const userCircuit = createLEDCircuitWithoutResistor();
    
    const result = await quest.validateSubmission(userCircuit);
    
    expect(result.isCorrect).toBe(false);
    expect(result.educationalFeedback).toContain('current limiting');
    expect(result.suggestedFix).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```
